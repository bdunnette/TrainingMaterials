# License

Unless specifically noted in the LICENSE.md file for a directory, all content is [Creative Commons CC-0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). 

## Rationale for CC-0 license

The collaborative nature of many of the documents included makes separating out individual attribution impractical. For example, a single contributor might add or correct a limited number of lines of example code. The onus of sorting through commit histories to determine the specific contributor would nullify the goal of making these resources freely and easily available for adaptation.

## Contributor responsibilities

Contributors who would like to make their contributions clear should add to the LICENSE.md file what files they contributed, what other license under which they are licensing that file, and how they ask to be given credit, if appropriate. It is the contributor's responsibility to have a reasonable case that he or she can, in fact, assert a license -- that is, has a claim to copyright.

Pull requests that seem to assert copyright inappropriately will not be accepted.


## Be nice!

Always check the LICENSE.md file in each folder. Contributors who would like to make their contributions clear should add to the licence file what files they contributed, what other license under which they are licensing that file, and how they ask to be given credit, if appropriate. It is the contributor's responsibility to have a reasonable case that he or she can, in fact, assert a license.
